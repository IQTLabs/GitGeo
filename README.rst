GitGeo
======

Discover the geography of open-source software. Explore the geographic locations of software developers associated with a GitHub repository or a Python (PyPI) package.

See, for instance, the geography of the contributors to the Python package requests.

Why use GitGeo?
---------------


* Curiosity
* Open source software community management
* Research on open source software ecosystems
* IT security compliance

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gitgeo

Usage
-----

(requires internet connection)


* 
  First, create one or more `GitHub personal access tokens <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token>`_.

* 
  Second, run these commands in the command line to set environmental variables:

  .. code-block:: bash

     export GITHUB_USERNAME='[github_username]'
     export GITHUB_TOKEN='[github_token]'

* 
  Alternatively, to use multiple tokens, create a file called tokens.txt in the code's directory and enter
  a GitHub personal access token on each line.

* 
  Third, run these commands in the command line:

``gitgeo --package [package_name]``

``gitgeo --repo [github_repo_url]``

For example:

``>>> gitgeo --package requests``

.. code-block::

   -----------------
   PACKAGE: requests
   -----------------
   CONTRIBUTOR, LOCATION
   * indicates PyPI maintainer
   ---------------------
   kennethreitz42 | Virginia, USA
   Lukasa * | London, England
   sigmavirus24 | Madison, WI
   nateprewitt * | None
   slingamn | None
   BraulioVM | Malaga & Granada, Spain
   dpursehouse | Kawasaki
   jgorset | Oslo, Norway
   ...

Or:

``>>> gitgeo --repo www.github.com/psf/requests``

.. code-block::

   -----------------
   GITHUB REPO: psf/requests
   -----------------
   CONTRIBUTOR, LOCATION
   ---------------------
   kennethreitz42 | Virginia, USA | United States
   Lukasa | London, England | United Kingdom
   sigmavirus24 | Madison, WI | United States
   nateprewitt | None | None
   ...

There are other command line options too:

Add ``--summary`` to get the results summarized by country. e.g.

``>>> gitgeo --package requests --summary``

.. code-block::

   -----------------
   PACKAGE: requests
   GITHUB REPO: psf/requests
   -----------------
   COUNTRY | # OF CONTRIBUTORS
   ---------------------------
   United States 37
   None 23
   United Kingdom 4
   Canada 4
   Germany 4
   Switzerland 4
   Spain 2
   Russia 2
   ...

Add ``--map`` when using the ``--repo`` option to create an html map
saved in the results folder. See image above for static example. Real map
includes zooming and tooltip capability.

Add ``--ouput_csv`` to output csv of results to results folder.

To create a csv of contributors from many repositories, enter repositories
on separate lines in the repos.txt file. Then use the ``--multirepo`` flag.

Add ``multirepo_map`` and then a filename to create a map of csv ouput. csv output must be located in the results folder.

Add ``--num`` and specify a multiple of 100 from 100 (default) to 500 to
specify the number of contributors analyzed per repo.

Run tests:
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest

Roadmap
-------


* Investigate capability of predicting location via a model given only timestamp from commit and commit-related data. (Kinga)
* Investigate GitHub API for examining merges and who has merge rights.
* Add capability of reading through commits and, specifically, (1) determine if GitHub commit rights can be inferred.
* Investigate capability of extracting all users associated with a GitHub group
* Investigate capability to determine authenticity of location information
* Investigate possibility of geographic diversity score for a repo or package
* Investigate possibility of linking emails in commits to email breach lists.
* Investigate possibility of determining whether a project is a "hobby" project (outside of working hours) or a "work" project (within working hours)?
* Investigate possibility of using NLP to determine codebase specialties of each contributor. e.g.
  This person is the "auth" person.
* Investigate over time commit analysis visualization
* Add dump multirepo results (or similar aggregate scan) to s3 capability
* Investigate diff to tweet capability. Reveal major contributor changes in critical projects to an open feed.
* Investigate switching ownership data. Would be interesting to alert users to this.
* Investigate by user capability. Determine all repo's a user has contributed to. Do a quick git blame for a user.

Rainy Day Options
-----------------


* Access commercial API's to enrich data on GitHub usernames or, if included in GitHub profile, email handles, etc. Perhaps People Data Labs or Explorium. (MK)

Potential Research Questions
----------------------------


* Are there places in the world with unrecognized pockets of software developers?
* Where are maintainers associated with the most critical python packages?

  * Who are the maintainers that are associated with multiple critical python packages?
  * What about contribution-related weighting?

* Where are the maintainers associated with the top GitHub packages by stars? Top data science packages? Quantum computing packages? Blockhcain packages? Etc? (RP)

  * Then do sub-analysis that asks on what repos or types of repos developers of a given country are most active

* What predicts the number of top python packages software developers by country?

  * Total number of coders per country?
  * Total number of python coders per country?
  * GDP per capita per country?

* Is it possible to "verify" user information?

Known bugs

Want to contribute?
-------------------


* Open a PR. We are glad to accept pull requests. We use black and pylint and
  pydocstyle, though we are glad to help if you haven't used those tools before.
* Open an issue. Tell us your problem or a functionality you want.
* Want to help build a community related to GitGeo and similar open source software
  ecosystem exploration tools? Please send an email to jmeyers@iqt.org.
